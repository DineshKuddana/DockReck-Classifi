# **Dockreck**

Dockreck is a powerful document classification and management tool that leverages AI to categorize documents and organize them into structured folders. With an easy-to-use interface and seamless Google Drive integration, Dockreck simplifies document workflows for users by automating the categorization and organization process. Users can also retrain the model using their input for improved accuracy over time.

## **Project Structure**

### **Backend**
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Key Files**:
  - `app.py`: Main Flask server file that handles API requests.
  - `classify.py`: Contains logic for categorizing documents.
  - `training.py` and `train_transformer.py`: Scripts for retraining the AI model using updated user data.
  - `extract_text.py`: Extracts text content from uploaded documents for classification.
  - `global_config.py`: Configuration settings for the project.
  - `category_classifier.pkl` and `subcategory_classifier.pkl`: Pre-trained model files for categorization.
  - `credentials.json`: Used for authenticating Google Drive API.
  - `librarymodule.py`: Handles file operations for saving documents to Google Drive.

- **Folders**:
  - **processed**: Stores initial training data for model bootstrapping.
  - **uploads**: Temporarily stores user-uploaded files.
  - **tokens**: Stores session or authentication tokens.

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: ReactJS (with Vite for development and build).
- **Key Files**:
  - `main.jsx`: Defines application routes.
  - `App.jsx`: Main application file rendering components.
  - **Components**:
    - `NavBar.jsx`: Handles navigation between routes.
    - `MainComp.jsx`: Allows users to upload documents.
    - `CategoryComp.jsx`: Displays categorized documents with options to edit and save them.
    - `LibraryComp.jsx`: Manages saved files in Google Drive.
  - **Styling**:
    - Scoped CSS modules for individual components (e.g., `CategoryComp.module.css`).

## **Workflow**

1. **Upload Files**:
   - Drag-and-drop or click the upload button in the `MainComp`.
   - Files are stored temporarily in the `uploads` folder.

2. **Categorization**:
   - Files are classified into categories and subcategories using pre-trained models.
   - Users can edit these classifications in `CategoryComp`.

3. **Save to Library**:
   - Edited files are saved to Google Drive in structured folders.

4. **Retraining**:
   - When users save edited categories, the changes are logged and used for retraining the AI models via `training.py`.
