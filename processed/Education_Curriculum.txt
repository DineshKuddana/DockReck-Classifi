Module 2: Coding Languages
Objective: Introduce students to various coding languages, developing their problem-solving and programming skills progressively through project-based learning.

Grade K-5 (Elementary)
Key Concepts: Basic computational thinking, simple algorithms, and block-based programming.
Activities:
Scratch Programming: Students learn coding fundamentals by creating simple animations, games, and stories with Scratch, a visual programming language.
Unplugged Coding: Activities that teach sequencing, loops, and conditionals without using computers, such as creating a coded treasure hunt.
Storytelling with Code: Students create interactive stories or games using Scratch, developing their creativity and coding skills simultaneously.
Assessment: Students will demonstrate their projects (games, animations) and explain the coding concepts used in their work.
Grade 6-8 (Middle School)
Key Concepts: Variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Introduction to text-based languages like Python.
Activities:
Introduction to Python: Students learn Python through interactive tutorials and mini-projects (e.g., simple calculators, text-based games).
Project-Based Learning: Build interactive applications, websites, or games using HTML/CSS and Python.
Code Debugging: Students practice debugging and improving code by working through problems and optimizing algorithms.
Assessment: Students submit a coding portfolio of their work and demonstrate an understanding of key programming concepts through written tests or quizzes.
Grade 9-12 (High School)
Key Concepts: Object-oriented programming (OOP), algorithms, data structures, web development, and database management.
Activities:
Advanced Python: Students learn advanced Python techniques, including OOP, libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas), and working with APIs.
Web Development: Students build dynamic websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as Django or Flask.
App Development: Design and develop mobile apps for Android or iOS using coding platforms like App Inventor or Swift.
Machine Learning Basics: Introduction to machine learning and data science with Python, building predictive models using simple datasets.
Assessment: Students develop a final project, such as a web application, mobile app, or machine learning model, and present it to the class.
Module 3: Environmental Science Projects
Objective: Engage students in hands-on, experiential learning through environmental science projects that encourage sustainable practices and exploration of real-world ecological challenges.

Grade K-5 (Elementary)
Key Concepts: Ecosystems, conservation, and the importance of sustainability.
Activities:
Waste Management Project: Students explore the importance of recycling by creating a recycling system for their school or local community.
Nature Walks and Observations: Students learn about local plants, animals, and ecosystems, documenting their observations.
Eco-friendly Gardening: Introduction to sustainable gardening practices by planting a garden using recycled materials.
Assessment: Students will create a report or presentation on their environmental projects and share their findings with the class.
Grade 6-8 (Middle School)
Key Concepts: Pollution, renewable energy, and biodiversity.
Activities:
