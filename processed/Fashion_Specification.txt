Anti-slip silicone strips to ensure heel stability during activity.
Toe Box:
Wider toe box to reduce crowding and provide extra room for comfort.
Reinforced toe cap for added protection and durability.
Ventilation:
Strategically placed mesh zones in high-sweat areas (toe, arch, and heel) for breathability.
Perforated holes on the upper to increase airflow and minimize moisture buildup.
5. Production Methods
1. Prototyping:
Software Used: CAD (Computer-Aided Design) for digital prototyping and 3D modeling of sneaker design.
Techniques: Rapid prototyping using 3D printing for sole and upper components, ensuring precision and fit before mass production.
2. Manufacturing Process:
Cutting: Laser cutting technology to precisely cut materials with minimal waste.
Stitching & Bonding:
Automated stitching for uniform seams.
High-quality thermoplastic bonding for securing the sole to the upper with a durable, water-tight seal.
Assembly:
Hand-assembly in certain components, including lace attachment and final quality checks.
Use of advanced molding for sole construction to improve ergonomics and structural integrity.
3. Quality Control:
Durability Testing:
Abrasion tests for outsole durability, especially in high-wear areas.
Flexibility tests to ensure the upper material maintains shape after repeated use.
Comfort Testing:
Wear trials conducted on different foot types to validate ergonomic design.
Pressure distribution mapping to ensure optimal comfort.
Environmental Testing:
Shoes are subjected to extreme temperature and humidity variations to assess material performance in diverse conditions.
4. Sustainability:
Materials: Recycled or eco-friendly synthetic options used in key areas like laces and packaging.
