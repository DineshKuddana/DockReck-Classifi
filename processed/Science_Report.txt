Laboratory Experiment Report: Efficiency of Different Materials in Solar Cell Technology
1. Introduction
Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources, with solar cells (photovoltaic cells) converting sunlight into electricity. The efficiency of these cells depends on the materials used to capture sunlight and convert it into electrical energy. This experiment studies the efficiency of different materials used in solar cell technology, including silicon, perovskite, and cadmium telluride (CdTe). The experiment investigates the energy output of these materials under varying conditions, such as light intensity and temperature, to determine their potential for future use in large-scale solar applications.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials Used
Monocrystalline Silicon: Known for high efficiency and durability, used in most traditional solar panels.
Perovskite: A newer material that has shown promise for its high efficiency and low cost.
Cadmium Telluride (CdTe): Another thin-film technology material, known for its cost-effectiveness but lower efficiency compared to silicon.
2.2 Equipment
Solar Cells: Three sets of solar cells, each made from one of the materials listed above.
Light Source: A simulated sunlight source, adjustable in intensity.
Temperature Control Unit: To maintain different ambient temperature conditions.
Multimeter: To measure the electrical output (voltage and current) of the solar cells.
Data Logger: For recording voltage, current, and temperature.
2.3 Experimental Procedure
Initial Setup: Each solar cell material is mounted on a separate platform connected to a multimeter and data logger. The light source is placed at a fixed distance from the solar cells to simulate natural sunlight.
Light Intensity Variation: The light source intensity is adjusted in increments (100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 lux) while recording the voltage and current at each intensity level.
Temperature Variation: Temperature is controlled and varied between 25¬∞C, 35¬∞C, and 45¬∞C. Voltage and current are measured at each temperature.
Energy Output Calculation: Energy output is calculated using the formula:

2.4 Data Collection
Energy output data was recorded for each material under both varying light intensity and temperature conditions. Each experiment was repeated three times to ensure accuracy.

3. Results
3.1 Energy Output vs. Light Intensity
The energy output for each material was measured at different light intensities. The graphs below show the relationship between light intensity and energy output for each material.

Graph 1: Energy Output vs. Light Intensity (100 - 500 lux)
Light Intensity (lux)	Monocrystalline Silicon (W)	Perovskite (W)	CdTe (W)
100	0.20	0.15	0.12
200	0.40	0.30	0.25
300	0.60	0.45	0.37
400	0.75	0.55	0.45
500	0.85	0.65	0.50
Observation: As light intensity increases, the energy output of all materials increases. Monocrystalline silicon consistently generates the highest energy output, followed by perovskite and CdTe.

3.2 Energy Output vs. Temperature
The following data shows how temperature affects the energy output of the three materials.

Graph 2: Energy Output vs. Temperature (25¬∞C, 35¬∞C, 45¬∞C)
Temperature (¬∞C)	Monocrystalline Silicon (W)	Perovskite (W)	CdTe (W)
25	0.85	0.65	0.50
35	0.80	0.60	0.45
45	0.75	0.55	0.40
Observation: As temperature increases, the energy output decreases for all materials. Silicon shows a more significant decrease in output with rising temperature compared to perovskite and CdTe.

4. Discussion
4.1 Light Intensity Effects
From the results, it is evident that all three materials show an increase in energy output as light intensity rises. Monocrystalline silicon consistently outperforms the other materials across all light intensities, making it the most efficient material under varying lighting conditions. However, perovskite and CdTe also show promising results, especially at moderate light intensities, indicating their potential as low-cost alternatives to silicon.

4.2 Temperature Effects
The experiment shows a clear trend of decreased energy output with rising temperature for all materials. This is a known issue for solar cells, as increased temperature can reduce the efficiency of the photovoltaic process. Monocrystalline silicon is particularly sensitive to temperature changes, which may limit its efficiency in hot climates. Perovskite, while also affected by temperature, shows slightly better performance in higher temperatures compared to silicon. CdTe maintains relatively consistent energy output even at higher temperatures, which makes it an attractive material for regions with high ambient temperatures.

4.3 Material Comparisons
Monocrystalline Silicon: Best overall performance in terms of energy output, but it is sensitive to temperature and typically more expensive.
Perovskite: Shows good energy output, especially at moderate light intensities, and performs better in high-temperature environments compared to silicon. It holds promise as a cost-effective material for solar cells.
Cadmium Telluride: Though it has the lowest energy output in both tests, its performance remains stable across light intensities and temperatures, making it an interesting material for low-cost solar applications.
5. Conclusion
The experiment confirms that while monocrystalline silicon remains the most efficient material in terms of energy output, perovskite and CdTe offer competitive performance at lower costs, especially in regions with high temperatures. Each material has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of material for solar cells will depend on the specific environmental conditions and cost constraints. Further research into improving the efficiency and thermal stability of perovskite and CdTe could make them viable alternatives to silicon in future solar technology.
